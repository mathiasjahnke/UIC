## user interface components

some weired ideas for user interface components for [processing](http://www.processing.org). 
this is work in progress, not stable, not well documented and no good design.

to run the project, processings **core.jar** needs to be on the class path. the javadocs for processing can be found here: "http://processing.github.io/processing-javadocs/core/". The java version for this project is 1.8.0_77.

great thanks to the [processing foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) for their work on processing, p5.js and processing.py.
